# ipinfo
ipinfo is a powerful API that provides detailed information about IP addresses, including geolocation, organization (ASN), hostname, VPN/proxy indicators, and regional details. 
By using a small Python script, Ubuntu users can query ipinfo to analyze traceroute hops, generate interactive maps, visualize network paths, and understand how traffic moves across the internet for troubleshooting or research.
